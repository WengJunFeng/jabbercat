JabberCat is an instant messenger which uses the long-established Jabber
network (based on XMPP). It is written in Python using Qt 5.

This page will at some point become a nice entry page. However, at the current
state of development, we prefer to invest manpower into actual features and
polishing the app itself. We hope you understand ðŸ˜º.

(If you want to help out with that though, feel free to get in touch.)

We suggest that you head over to the :ref:`testing-guide` now.
