If you are intrigued by the User Experience provided by modern, non-XMPP and/or
non-free chat applications, this is for you. We aim to provide
Conversations-like chat experience based on XMPP on the Desktop!

How to test
===========

We have a `Testing Guide <https://jabbercat.org/testing>`_ which gives detailed
instructions on how to install, how to do useful tests, which issues to (not)
report and how to report them.


Get in touch
============

To get in touch with us, the best way is to `join the MUC at jabbercat@conference.zombofant.net <xmpp:jabbercat@conference.zombofant.net?join>`_.
Of course, issue reports are also somewhat a way to get in touch, but much more
formal ðŸ˜º.
