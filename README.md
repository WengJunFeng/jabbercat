=========================================================

The JabberÂ® client of the future! ðŸŽ‰

If you are intrigued by the User Experience provided by modern, non-XMPP and/or
non-free chat applications, this is for you. We aim to provide
Conversations-like chat experience based on XMPP on the Desktop!

How to test
===========

We have a [Testing Guide](https://jabbercat.org/testing) which gives detailed
instructions on how to install, how to do useful tests, which issues to (not)
report and how to report them.


Get in touch
============

To get in touch with us, the best way is to
[join the MUC at jabbercat@conference.zombofant.net](xmpp:jabbercat@conference.zombofant.net?join).
Of course, issue reports are also somewhat a way to get in touch, but much more
formal ðŸ˜º. Tip: if youâ€™re already connected with JabberCat, you can easily join
the MUC from the Help menu.
